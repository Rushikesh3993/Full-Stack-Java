sql is structured query language
structure query language means store and manage the data in relational database management system.
sql is used for database creation , deletion, fetching , row and modifying rows.
tuffle means - rows 
table is know as relation
sql is not case sensitive.


//database
- create database mydb;
- drop database mydb;
- rename database mydb TO mysql;
- use mydb;

//table
- create table table_name(column_name1 datatype, column_name2 datatype);
- create table student(rollno int(255), name varchar(50));
- insert into student(rollno,name)values(1, "Rushi");
- DELETE FROM student
WHERE rollno = 1 AND name = 'Rushi'
LIMIT 1;


//DELETE
- delete from student; //dml
  means only table content will be delete
- drop table student; //ddl
  means it will delete whole table with structure.
- delete from student where rollno = 1;
- delete from student where name = 'Sham';

//clauses
- WHERE
- orderby


- create table student(id int(255) auto_increment, name varchar(100),   primary key(id));
- insert into student(name)values('abc);  //1 abc
- insert into student(name)values('xyz'); //2 xyz
- delete from student;
- insert into student(name)values('pqr'); //3 pqr
- truncate table student;
- insert into student(name)values('lmn'); //1 lmn

⬇️

🔹 1. DELETE

-  Removes specific rows from a table (using WHERE).
  
-  If WHERE is not given → all rows will be deleted.
  
-  Slower than TRUNCATE (checks each row).
  
-  Can be rolled back (if inside a transaction).
  
-  Does not reset AUTO_INCREMENT counter.

Example:

- DELETE FROM students WHERE rollno = 5;

🔹 2. TRUNCATE

- Removes all rows from a table (cannot use WHERE).

- Very fast (doesn’t check each row).

- Resets AUTO_INCREMENT counter.

- Cannot be rolled back in some DBMS (like MySQL).

- Table structure remains.

👉 Example:

- TRUNCATE TABLE students;

🔹 3. DROP

- Deletes the entire table (structure + data).

- After DROP, the table no longer exists.

- Cannot be rolled back.

👉 Example:

- DROP TABLE students;


👉 So, in short:

- DELETE = remove some rows

- TRUNCATE = empty the table

- DROP = remove the whole table
